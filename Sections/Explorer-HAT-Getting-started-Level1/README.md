# Level 1 -  Explorer HAT - README.md
As part of the Northern Ireland Raspberry Jams, we have a set of Pimoroni Explorer HAT Pros. This is a level one (complete beginner) set of activities which only use the built in inputs and outputs.   
It is recommended you also pick up some crocodile clips and a conductive material, for example tinfoil or playdough.   
For the Scratch activity, Simon Walters ScratchGPIO is required. At the time of writing this, reliable support for the Explorer HAT is only available in [ScratchGPIO7Dev](http://simplesi.net/scratchgpio-development-testing/).   
Apart from the [Pimoroni Explorer HAT library](https://github.com/pimoroni/explorer-hat), no other software is required for the Python activity.
