# Level 2 -  Traffic Explorer - README.md
As part of the Northern Ireland Raspberry Jams, we have access to a [old full sized traffic light](https://twitter.com/wizardSignal) that was found while in the process of getting scrapped.   
The activity in this section makes use of this traffic light and [David Whale's](https://twitter.com/whaleygeek) excellent [network.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspberrypilearning/networking-lessons/master/lesson-1/code/network.py) library, a massively simplified networking library for Python.   
Note, this must be installs on all the Raspberry Pis for this activity.   
   
Some [example server](NetworkCode/trafficServer.py) code is included. It works for any resources you have to share, not just a traffic light. It writes the received string to a text file which another other application can read from.
